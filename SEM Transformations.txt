Biomass Model (Saturated; m1): 
Biomass ~ PercentAg(*) + PercentLocalVeg_50m + Julian(*) + WaterQuality + EnvDetection

Biomass Model (Final; m1):
Biomass ~ log(PercentAg) + Julian

1. Initially had issues with overdispersion
	*tried log(PercentAg) and that helped, better AIC than polynomial transformations and no transformations
	*Quadratic and cubic transformations did not help 
2. Season and Julian both significant, Julian had better fit (AIC) so I used Julian
3. Final model is good


---------
 
Body Condition Index Model (Saturated; m2):
Body Condition Index ~ Biomass + PlasmaDetection + Species/Group(*) + time of day + SPEI + (1|Site)
**Julian & SPEI correlated but have very similar influence so I kept SPEI because its of greater interest

Body Condition Index (Final; m2):
Body Condition Index ~ Species/Group --> NOT VERY INTERESTING, BREAK UP BODY CONDITION?

1. Removing site (as a random effect) improved model fit. Site was not contributing anything to the model. 
2. Species (346 AIC, df = 9) performs better than Group (294 AIC, df = 17)
3. Both Species and Group are significant (only significant predictor here)
4. Slightly heteroscedasticity issues
5. Saturated model diagnostics all looked good.

Grouping Species to Reduce # of Levels (Different Approaches):

1. Leave as is (11 levels)
2. Combine by migratory status
	*Uneven sample sizes...
3. Combine by foraging guild/bill size

Bill Length Groupings:
1. Long: Marbled Godwit (1) + American Avocet (4) + Dowitchers (7) + Willet (10) + Greater Yellowlegs (2) # 24
2. Medium: Lesser Yellowlegs (54) + Wilson's Phalarope (19) + Pectoral Sandpiper (16) # 89
3. Short: Least Sandpiper (33) + Semipalmated Sandpiper (21) + Killdeer (15) # 69


4. "Other" category that just includes rare birds
5. Combine by microhabitats for foraging
	*American Avocet: 15-20cm foraging depths; pecking, plunging, snatching, bill pursuit, filtering, scraping, scything; scything and probing most common
	*Lesser Yellowlegs: 2-16cm foraging depths; surface feeder, pecking
	*Greater Yellowlegs: similar to Lesser Yellowlegs
	*Killdeer: very shallow water; probes into mud
	*Willet: wihtin 10cm; pecking/tapping
	*Wilson's Phalarope: deep water; spinning, pecking prey from surface
	*Least Sandpiper: shallow water; pecking
	*Semipalmated Sandpiper: shallow water; pecking
	*Pectoral Sandpiper: shallow-ish to Lesser Yellowlegs deep water; pecking
